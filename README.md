# CustomSquareSpaceNavBar
A freelance project I did to create a  'mega-menu' that would be used in SquareSpace

Fun little project using only Javascript/Jquery and CSS. The fun of the challenge was trying to counteract some of the rules Squarespace put in place. See some of my comments for more information on that.
