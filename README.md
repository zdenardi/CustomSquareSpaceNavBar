# CustomSquareSpaceNavBar
A freelance project I did to create a  'mega-menu' that would be used in SquareSpace

Fun freelance using just Jquery and css. Part of the fun was trying to figure out how to override some of the Squarespace rules

Remember to import the libraries that you need!

# Injected.js #
 - This HAS to be injected in the code section of square space in <script> tags.
